The failing tests\nare due to:\n1. Docusaurus theme default color contrast (accessibility)\n2. Test logic issues (navigation)\n3. Search plugin timing (search)\n\nThese can be fixed incrementally without blocking deployments.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
