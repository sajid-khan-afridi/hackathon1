# Welcome to Physical AI

Welcome to the **Physical AI Book** - your comprehensive guide to understanding the fascinating world of robotics, embodied artificial intelligence, and intelligent physical systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate in the physical world through robotic bodies, sensors, and actuators. Unlike traditional AI that exists purely in software, Physical AI must:

- **Perceive** the physical world through sensors
- **Reason** about spatial relationships and physical constraints
- **Act** on the environment through motors and actuators
- **Learn** from physical interactions and experiences

## What You'll Learn

This book is structured as a **13-week progressive curriculum** organized into 4 modules, taking you from foundational concepts to building fully autonomous humanoid robots:

### Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals (Weeks 1-5)
- Introduction to Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Python-based robotics development with rclpy
- URDF robot model definition for humanoid systems

### Module 2: Robot Simulation (Weeks 6-7)
- Gazebo environment setup and physics simulation
- Unity introduction for photorealistic rendering
- Sensor simulation: LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Human-robot interaction scenario development

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform (Weeks 8-10)
- Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim with GPU-accelerated simulation
- AI-powered perception and computer vision
- Reinforcement learning for bipedal locomotion
- Nav2 path planning and autonomous navigation

### Module 4: Humanoid Development & Conversational Robotics (Weeks 11-13)
- Humanoid kinematics, dynamics, and bipedal locomotion
- Manipulation and grasping with MoveIt
- OpenAI Whisper integration for voice recognition
- GPT-powered natural language to ROS 2 action systems

### Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid
Integrate all 4 modules to build a simulated humanoid robot that receives voice commands, plans paths, identifies objects, and manipulates them autonomously.

## How to Use This Book

The content is organized with **progressive complexity**:

- 🟢 **Beginner**: Start here if you're new to robotics and AI
- 🟡 **Intermediate**: Build on foundational knowledge
- 🔴 **Advanced**: Deep technical details for experienced practitioners

Each page includes:
- **Learning objectives**: What you'll understand after reading
- **Prerequisites**: What you should know before starting
- **Estimated time**: How long the content takes to read
- **Keywords**: Key concepts covered

## Getting Started

Ready to begin your 13-week journey into Physical AI and humanoid robotics?

**For Sequential Learners**: Start with [Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./module-01-ros2/) and progress through all 13 weeks to the Capstone Project.

**For Educators**: Review the module structures to design your semester-long course. Each module includes learning objectives, prerequisites, and assessment points.

**For Self-Directed Learners**: Jump to any module that matches your interests. Each module includes prerequisites and cross-references to earlier content.

**For Project-Based Learning**: Explore the [Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project](./capstone/) to see how all modules integrate into a complete system.

Use the **search** feature in the navigation bar to find specific topics, and check the [Glossary](./glossary.md) for robotics terminology.
