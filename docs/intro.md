# Welcome to Physical AI

Welcome to the **Physical AI Book** - your comprehensive guide to understanding the fascinating world of robotics, embodied artificial intelligence, and intelligent physical systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate in the physical world through robotic bodies, sensors, and actuators. Unlike traditional AI that exists purely in software, Physical AI must:

- **Perceive** the physical world through sensors
- **Reason** about spatial relationships and physical constraints
- **Act** on the environment through motors and actuators
- **Learn** from physical interactions and experiences

## What You'll Learn

This book is structured to take you from foundational concepts to advanced applications:

### Chapter 1: Foundations
- History and evolution of robotics
- Core concepts in Physical AI
- Key components of robotic systems
- The relationship between AI and robotics

### Chapter 2: Mechanics and Control
- Kinematics and dynamics
- Actuators and sensors
- Control systems
- Motion planning

### Coming Soon
Additional chapters covering perception, learning, human-robot interaction, and real-world applications.
