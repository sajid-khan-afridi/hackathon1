# Foundations of Physical AI

Welcome to **Chapter 1: Foundations**. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts that form the basis of Physical AI and robotics. Whether you're completely new to the field or looking to solidify your understanding, this chapter will provide you with essential knowledge.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, we'll cover:

1. **Introduction to Physical AI** - What Physical AI is and why it matters
2. **History and Evolution** - How robotics has developed from early automata to modern intelligent systems
3. **Key Concepts** - Core terminology, principles, and frameworks
4. **System Components** - The building blocks of robotic systems

## Why Foundations Matter

Understanding the foundations of Physical AI is crucial because:

- **Context**: Historical perspective helps you understand current challenges
- **Terminology**: Shared vocabulary enables clear communication
- **Principles**: Core concepts apply across all robotic systems
- **Integration**: Foundations show how different components work together

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into progressive sections:

1. **Introduction** - Overview of Physical AI and its significance
2. **History** - Evolution from mechanical automata to intelligent robots
3. **Key Concepts** - Essential terminology and principles

Each section builds on the previous one, so we recommend reading them in order.
