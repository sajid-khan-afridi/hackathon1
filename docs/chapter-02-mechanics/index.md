# Mechanics and Control

Welcome to **Chapter 2: Mechanics and Control**. This chapter dives into the physical aspects of robotics - how robots move, sense their environment, and execute precise motions.

## What You'll Learn

This chapter covers the mechanical and control foundations of Physical AI:

1. **Kinematics and Dynamics** - Mathematics of motion
2. **Actuators and Sensors** - How robots move and perceive
3. **Control Systems** - Achieving precise, stable motion

## Why Mechanics and Control Matter

Understanding mechanics and control is essential because:

- **Precision**: Robots must move accurately and repeatably
- **Stability**: Control systems keep robots from falling or oscillating
- **Efficiency**: Good mechanical design minimizes energy consumption
- **Safety**: Proper control ensures robots operate safely near humans

## Real-World Applications

The concepts in this chapter enable:

- **Industrial manipulation**: Assembly, welding, painting with millimeter precision
- **Autonomous navigation**: Self-driving cars, warehouse robots, drones
- **Humanoid locomotion**: Walking, running, climbing stairs
- **Collaborative robots**: Safe interaction with human workers

## Chapter Structure

1. **Kinematics and Dynamics**
   - Forward and inverse kinematics
   - Velocity and acceleration
   - Forces and torques
   - Dynamic equations of motion

2. **Actuators and Sensors**
   - Electric motors, hydraulics, pneumatics
   - Cameras, lidar, force sensors
   - Proprioceptive vs. exteroceptive sensing

3. **Control Systems**
   - PID control
   - Model-based control
   - Adaptive and learning-based control

## Mathematical Prerequisites

This chapter uses:
- **Linear algebra**: Vectors, matrices, transformations
- **Calculus**: Derivatives for velocity and acceleration
- **Basic physics**: Force, torque, energy

Don't worry if your math is rusty - we'll explain concepts intuitively with examples and visualizations.
