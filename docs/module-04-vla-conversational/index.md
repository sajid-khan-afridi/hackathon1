# Module 4: Humanoid Development & Conversational Robotics

Welcome to **Module 4: Humanoid Development & Conversational Robotics**. This capstone module integrates kinematics, bipedal locomotion, manipulation, and conversational AI to create fully autonomous humanoid systems that understand and respond to natural language commands. You'll build robots that walk, grasp objects, and interact naturally with humans.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this module, you will:

- **Master humanoid kinematics**: Calculate forward and inverse kinematics for arm manipulation and whole-body motion
- **Implement bipedal locomotion**: Design and tune controllers for stable walking, turning, and dynamic balance
- **Develop grasping strategies**: Use MoveIt to plan and execute pick-and-place operations with humanoid hands
- **Integrate voice recognition**: Implement OpenAI Whisper for real-time speech-to-text conversion
- **Build conversational interfaces**: Connect GPT models to translate natural language commands into ROS 2 actions
- **Create multi-modal systems**: Combine voice, vision, and action execution for seamless human-robot collaboration

## Module Structure

This module spans **3 weeks** covering advanced humanoid capabilities and conversational AI:

1. **Week 11: Humanoid Kinematics & Dynamics** - Forward/inverse kinematics, Jacobians, dynamics equations, and whole-body control
2. **Week 12: Bipedal Locomotion & Manipulation** - Walking controllers, balance algorithms, MoveIt grasping, and pick-and-place
3. **Week 13: Conversational Robotics & Capstone Integration** - OpenAI Whisper integration, GPT voice-to-action, natural language ROS 2 commands, and multi-modal interaction

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- **Completed Modules 1-3**: Comprehensive understanding of ROS 2, simulation, and AI perception
- **ROS 2 actions expertise**: Experience with action servers and clients
- **Nav2 familiarity**: Knowledge of path planning and navigation from Module 3
- **AI perception skills**: Computer vision and object detection from Module 3
- **Python async programming**: Understanding of asynchronous operations (helpful but not required)
