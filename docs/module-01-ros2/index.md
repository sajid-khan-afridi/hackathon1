# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals**. This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the foundational middleware for modern robotics. You'll learn the core concepts, architecture, and practical skills needed to build distributed robotic systems, with a focus on humanoid robotics applications.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this module, you will:

- **Understand Physical AI foundations**: Explore what Physical AI is, embodied intelligence principles, and the humanoid robotics landscape
- **Master ROS 2 architecture**: Learn about DDS middleware, quality of service (QoS) policies, and the publish-subscribe communication pattern
- **Build ROS 2 nodes**: Create executable processes that communicate via topics, services, and actions
- **Develop with Python**: Implement rclpy-based packages for sensor processing, motor control, and system integration
- **Model humanoid robots**: Define robot structures using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)

## Module Structure

This module spans **5 weeks** covering foundational Physical AI concepts and ROS 2 development:

1. **Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI** - Explore Physical AI foundations, embodied intelligence, and the humanoid robotics landscape
2. **Week 2: Embodied Intelligence** - Understand sensor systems, perception, and intelligent embodiment principles
3. **Week 3: ROS 2 Architecture** - Learn ROS 2 design principles, DDS middleware, and core communication patterns
4. **Week 4: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions** - Create nodes and implement various communication mechanisms
5. **Week 5: Python Packages & URDF** - Build rclpy packages and define humanoid robot models

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- **Basic Python knowledge**: Variables, functions, classes, loops, and error handling
- **Command-line skills**: Navigating directories, running scripts, and using package managers
- **Text editor proficiency**: VS Code, Vim, or similar tools for code editing

No prior robotics or ROS experience is required—we'll build everything from the ground up.
