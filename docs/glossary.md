# Glossary

A comprehensive reference of key terms and concepts used throughout the Physical AI Book.

## A

**Actuator**: A mechanical or electrical device that converts energy into physical motion, enabling robots to move and interact with their environment.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, including learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

## B

**Body Schema**: A robot's internal representation of its own physical structure and capabilities.

## C

**Control System**: A system that manages and regulates the behavior of a robot or mechanism through feedback loops.

## D

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: The number of independent parameters that define the configuration or position of a mechanical system.

## E

**Embodied AI**: Artificial intelligence that is physically instantiated in a robotic body and interacts with the real world.

**End Effector**: The device at the end of a robotic arm designed to interact with the environment (e.g., gripper, tool, sensor).

## F

**Forward Kinematics**: The process of calculating the position and orientation of a robot's end effector given its joint angles.

## I

**Inverse Kinematics**: The process of calculating the joint angles needed to achieve a desired position and orientation of the end effector.

## K

**Kinematics**: The study of motion without considering the forces that cause it.

## M

**Manipulation**: The ability of a robot to physically interact with and modify objects in its environment.

**Motion Planning**: The algorithmic process of finding a path for a robot to move from one configuration to another while avoiding obstacles.

## P

**Physical AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that operate in and interact with the physical world through sensors, actuators, and robotic bodies.

**Perception**: The process by which a robot acquires, interprets, and understands sensory information about its environment.

## R

**Robotic System**: An integrated system comprising sensors, actuators, control systems, and intelligence that enables autonomous or semi-autonomous operation.

## S

**Sensor**: A device that detects and measures physical properties of the environment (e.g., distance, temperature, force, light).

**Sensor Fusion**: The process of combining data from multiple sensors to produce more accurate and reliable information than could be obtained from any single sensor.

## T

**Trajectory**: A path through space as a function of time, describing how a robot moves from one position to another.
