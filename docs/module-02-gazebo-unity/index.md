# Module 2: Robot Simulation with Gazebo & Unity

Welcome to **Module 2: Robot Simulation**. This module introduces two powerful simulation environments—Gazebo and Unity—for developing and testing humanoid robots in virtual worlds before deploying to physical hardware. You'll learn to create realistic simulation environments with accurate physics, sensor models, and visual rendering.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this module, you will:

- **Master Gazebo fundamentals**: Set up simulation environments, spawn robot models, and configure physics engines
- **Work with URDF and SDF**: Define robot models with accurate kinematics, inertia, and collision geometry
- **Simulate physics accurately**: Implement gravity, friction, contact dynamics, and collision detection
- **Integrate Unity for rendering**: Create photorealistic environments for human-robot interaction scenarios
- **Model sensors realistically**: Simulate LiDAR, depth cameras, RGB cameras, and IMUs with accurate noise models

## Module Structure

This module spans **2 weeks** covering two complementary simulation platforms:

1. **Week 6: Gazebo Fundamentals** - Gazebo setup, URDF/SDF formats, physics simulation (gravity, collisions, joints)
2. **Week 7: Unity & Sensor Simulation** - Unity introduction, sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs), and HRI rendering

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- **Completed Module 1**: Understanding of ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- **URDF knowledge**: Familiarity with robot model definition from Module 1, Week 5
- **Basic 3D concepts**: Understanding of coordinate frames, transformations, and spatial reasoning
