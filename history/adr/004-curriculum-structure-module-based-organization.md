> **Scope**: Supersedes chapter-based content structure (ADR-003) with module-based 13-week curriculum organization for Physical AI book.

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-04
- **Feature:** 001-curriculum-restructure
- **Context:** Restructuring existing chapter-based documentation into a 4-module, 13-week progressive learning curriculum for Physical AI education

<!-- Significance checklist (ALL must be true to justify this ADR)
     1) Impact: YES - Fundamentally changes how content is organized and consumed, affecting all future curriculum development
     2) Alternatives: YES - Chapter-based (current), flat weekly structure, spiral curriculum all considered
     3) Scope: YES - Cross-cutting change affecting directory structure, navigation, metadata schema, and content authoring
-->

## Decision

We will adopt a **4-Module, 13-Week Curriculum Structure** replacing the current chapter-based organization:

### Module Organization:
- **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** (Weeks 1-5)
  - Introduction to Physical AI, Embodied Intelligence
  - ROS 2 Architecture, Nodes, Topics, Services
  - Python integration and URDF

- **Module 2: Robot Simulation** (Weeks 6-7)
  - Gazebo fundamentals and URDF/SDF modeling
  - Unity integration and sensor simulation

- **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac** (Weeks 8-10)
  - Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim
  - AI-powered perception and manipulation
  - Reinforcement learning and sim-to-real transfer

- **Module 4: VLA & Conversational Robotics** (Weeks 11-13)
  - Humanoid kinematics and dynamics
  - Bipedal locomotion and manipulation
  - Conversational robotics and capstone project

### Directory Structure Pattern:
```
docs/
├── intro.md                           # Updated with 13-week overview
├── module-01-ros2/                    # Module 1 folder
│   ├── index.md                       # Module overview (sidebar_position: 1)

```

### Frontmatter Schema Extension:
Extends ADR-003 schema with module/week-specific fields:

```yaml
---
title: "Week 3: ROS 2 Architecture"
description: "Explore ROS 2 architecture, DDS middleware, and pub-sub patterns"
sidebar_position: 3
week_number: 3                         # NEW: Global week (1-13)
module: "module-01-ros2"              # NEW: Parent module reference
difficulty: "beginner"
learning_objectives:
  - "Explain ROS 2 architecture and DDS middleware"
  - "Identify key components: nodes, topics, services"
prerequisites:
  - "Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI"
  - "Week 2: Embodied Intelligence"
estimated_time: "2 hours"
hands_on_exercises:                   # NEW: Required (min 1 per week)
  - title: "Inspect ROS 2 nodes"
    description: "Use CLI tools to explore running nodes"
    estimated_time: "30 minutes"
    tools_required: ["ROS 2 Humble", "Ubuntu 22.04"]
keywords:
  - "ROS 2 architecture"
  - "DDS middleware"
---
```

### Migration from Chapter-Based Structure:
- **Remove**: `docs/chapter-01-foundations/`, `docs/chapter-02-mechanics/`
- **Replace with**: 4 module folders + capstone folder
- **Preserve**: `intro.md`, `glossary.md` (updated references to new structure)

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Progressive Learning Path**: 13-week structure provides clear time-based progression from beginner to advanced topics
- **Thematic Clustering**: Modules group related technologies (ROS 2 ecosystem, simulation tools, AI frameworks) reducing context switching
- **Scalability**: Module-based organization supports incremental curriculum expansion (add Module 5 for advanced topics without restructuring)
- **Clear Prerequisites**: Week-based ordering makes prerequisite relationships explicit (Week 4 builds on Weeks 1-3)
- **Hands-On Focus**: Required `hands_on_exercises` field enforces practical learning (FR-015 compliance)
- **Capstone Integration**: Dedicated capstone folder ties all 4 modules together (FR-019 compliance)
- **Autogenerated Navigation**: Docusaurus sidebar auto-generates from module folders, preserving sequential order
- **Pedagogical Alignment**: Structure mirrors university semester format (familiar to learners and educators)

### Negative

- **Breaking Change**: Supersedes ADR-003 chapter-based structure - requires full content migration and URL updates
  - **Mitigation**: Implement redirects from old chapter URLs to new module/week URLs; document migration path
- **Rigid Time Structure**: 13-week constraint limits flexibility (adding content may require reorganizing weeks)
  - **Mitigation**: Use "bonus weeks" or "deep dives" as optional content outside main 13-week path
- **Module Boundaries**: Some topics span multiple modules (e.g., URDF used in Modules 1, 2, 3) creating cross-module dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: Use cross-references and "Prerequisites" frontmatter to link related content across modules
- **Increased Metadata**: Each page now requires `week_number`, `module`, `hands_on_exercises` fields (more frontmatter overhead)
  - **Mitigation**: Provide templates and frontmatter linter to validate required fields in CI
- **Migration Effort**: Existing placeholder content (chapter-01, chapter-02) must be rewritten to match new curriculum
  - **Mitigation**: Planned as primary implementation task; research.md and data-model.md provide detailed guidance

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Chapter-Based Structure (Current ADR-003)

**Description**: Keep existing chapter-based organization (`chapter-01-foundations/`, `chapter-02-mechanics/`, etc.)

**Pros**:
- No breaking changes (existing structure remains)
- Flexible chapter lengths (not constrained to weeks)
- Simpler metadata (no week numbers or module references)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Lacks clear learning timeline (learners don't know how long each chapter takes)
- ❌ No thematic clustering (chapters are linear, not grouped by technology stack)
- ❌ Harder to express prerequisites (chapter dependencies less clear than week-based)
- ❌ Doesn't align with spec requirement for "13-week curriculum" (FR-001, FR-002)

**Rejected because**: Fails to meet spec requirement for 13-week structured curriculum

### Alternative 2: Flat Weekly Structure (No Modules)

**Description**: Single `docs/` directory with `week-01.md`, `week-02.md`, ..., `week-13.md` files

**Pros**:
- Simplest structure (no nested folders)
- Clear sequential ordering (week numbers in filenames)
- Minimal navigation hierarchy

**Cons**:
- ❌ No thematic clustering (all weeks at same level, loses technology groupings)
- ❌ Poor sidebar organization (13 top-level items vs 4 module categories)
- ❌ Scalability issues (adding more weeks creates flat list of 20+ files)
- ❌ Loses module-level learning objectives (no overview pages for ROS 2, Isaac, etc.)

**Rejected because**: Sacrifices navigation clarity and thematic organization for marginal structural simplicity

### Alternative 3: Spiral Curriculum (Repeated Topics Across Modules)

**Description**: Revisit core concepts (sensors, actuators, control) in each module at increasing depth

**Pros**:
- Reinforces learning through repetition
- Allows late joiners to catch up in later modules
- Proven pedagogical approach for some domains

**Cons**:
- ❌ Increases content redundancy (same topics covered multiple times)
- ❌ Context-switching overhead (ROS 2 → Gazebo → ROS 2 → Isaac pattern)
- ❌ Harder to write (avoiding exact repetition while deepening concepts)
- ❌ Learners may feel curriculum is repetitive or slow-paced

**Rejected because**: Linear progressive model (Bloom's Taxonomy) better suits 13-week technical bootcamp format (research.md findings)
