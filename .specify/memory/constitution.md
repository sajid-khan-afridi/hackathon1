# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content-First Documentation
Every piece of content MUST be structured, accessible, and pedagogically sound. The book content MUST follow the **4-Module Curriculum Structure** spanning **13 weeks**, progressing from fundamental robotics middleware to advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. Each module MUST include clear learning objectives, practical examples, code samples, visual diagrams, and hands-on assessments.

**Book Structure (4 Modules, 13 Weeks):**

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** [Weeks 3-5]
   - Focus: Middleware for robot control (rclpy, URDF, nodes, topics, services)
   - Learning: Bridge Python AI agents to ROS 2 controllers for humanoid robots

2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** [Weeks 6-7]
   - Focus: Physics simulation and environment building
   - Learning: Simulate gravity, collisions, sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)

3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** [Weeks 8-10]
   - Focus: Advanced perception, VSLAM, navigation with Isaac Sim/ROS
   - Learning: Hardware-accelerated perception, Nav2 path planning, sim-to-real transfer

4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** [Weeks 11-13]
   - Focus: Convergence of LLMs and robotics (voice-to-action, cognitive planning)
   - Learning: OpenAI Whisper for voice commands, LLMs for natural language task planning, autonomous humanoid capstone

**Progressive Complexity Model:**
- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence (sensor systems, digital-to-physical transition)
- **Weeks 3-5**: ROS 2 fundamentals (nodes, topics, services, launch files)
- **Weeks 6-7**: Simulation with Gazebo and Unity (URDF/SDF, physics, visualization)
- **Weeks 8-10**: NVIDIA Isaac platform (Isaac SDK, Isaac Sim, AI-powered perception, RL)
- **Weeks 11-12**: Humanoid robot development (kinematics, bipedal locomotion, manipulation, natural interaction)
- **Week 13**: Conversational robotics (GPT integration, speech recognition, multi-modal interaction)

**Assessment Requirements:**
- ROS 2 package development project
- Gazebo simulation implementation
- Isaac-based perception pipeline
- **Capstone**: Simulated humanoid robot that receives voice commands, plans paths, navigates obstacles, identifies objects using computer vision, and manipulates them

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

**Rationale**: Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This curriculum bridges the gap between the digital brain (AI models) and the physical body (robotics), teaching students to deploy embodied intelligence that operates in physical space, not just digital environments.

### II. Docusaurus Architecture
The book MUST be implemented as a Docusaurus static site. All content MUST use Docusaurus conventions: docs/ for chapters, blog/ for updates, static/ for assets. The site structure MUST support versioning, search, and responsive design. Configuration MUST be maintainable and extensible.

**Sidebar Generation**: The book MUST use autogenerated sidebars (sidebars.ts: type='autogenerated'). Folder structure in docs/ directly maps to navigation hierarchy. New content files added to docs/ automatically appear in the sidebar without manual configuration.

**Frontmatter Requirements**: All content files MUST include YAML frontmatter with:
- `title`: Display name in sidebar (required)
- `sidebar_position`: Numeric ordering within category (required for sequential content)
- `description`: Brief summary for metadata (recommended)
- Additional custom fields (module, week, chapter_number) for curriculum organization

**Rationale**: Docusaurus provides enterprise-grade documentation infrastructure with excellent developer experience, built-in search, versioning, and GitHub Pages deployment support. Autogenerated sidebars ensure content automatically reflects in navigation without manual configuration, reducing maintenance burden and preventing documentation drift between file structure and displayed navigation.

### III. GitHub Pages Deployment
The book site MUST be deployable to GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD. Deployment MUST be triggered on main branch commits. The deployment pipeline MUST include build validation, link checking, and accessibility testing. The production URL MUST be stable and properly configured.

**Rationale**: GitHub Pages offers free, reliable hosting with excellent integration into the development workflow. Automated deployment ensures the published book always reflects the latest approved content.

### IV. RAG Chatbot Integration
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot MUST be embedded into the book. The chatbot MUST answer questions using ONLY the book's content as its knowledge base. The chatbot MUST cite sources with chapter and section references. The chatbot MUST support contextual queries from user-selected text passages.

**Rationale**: RAG enables interactive learning by allowing readers to query content dynamically, reinforcing understanding through conversational exploration while maintaining accuracy by grounding responses in the book's authoritative content.

### V. Hybrid Storage Architecture
The RAG system MUST use a hybrid storage approach:
- **Neon Serverless Postgres** for vector-text hybrid storage with pgvector extension
- **Qdrant Cloud Free Tier** for high-performance vector similarity search
- Text content and metadata MUST be stored in Postgres
- Embeddings MUST be stored in both systems for redundancy and optimization
- Queries MUST leverage Qdrant for fast similarity search, Postgres for full-text and metadata filtering

**Rationale**: Hybrid storage maximizes both performance and cost-efficiency. Qdrant provides specialized vector search capabilities while Neon Postgres ensures data durability, ACID compliance, and rich querying across text and vectors. This architecture supports scaling from free tier to production.

### VI. Modern AI Stack
The RAG chatbot backend MUST use:
- **FastAPI** for REST API endpoints (async, type-safe, auto-documented)
- **OpenAI Agents SDK / ChatKit** for conversational AI orchestration
- **OpenAI embeddings** (text-embedding-3-small or text-embedding-3-large) for vector generation
- **Streaming responses** for real-time user experience
- The frontend MUST use a modern JavaScript framework (React/Vue) for chat UI

**Rationale**: FastAPI provides production-grade Python API development with excellent performance and developer experience. OpenAI's ecosystem offers state-of-the-art language models and tooling. This stack is well-documented, widely adopted, and suitable for both prototyping and production.

### VII. Test-First for Critical Paths (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation for:
- RAG retrieval accuracy (precision/recall metrics)
- Chatbot response quality (ground truth comparisons)
- API endpoint contracts (request/response validation)
- Database operations (data integrity, vector search correctness)
- Deployment pipeline (build success, link validity)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is MANDATORY for backend services. Red-Green-Refactor cycle MUST be followed: write failing test → implement → refactor. All tests MUST pass before merging to main.

**Rationale**: RAG systems require rigorous testing to prevent hallucinations, ensure retrieval quality, and maintain system reliability. Test-first development catches issues early and provides regression safety as the system evolves.

## Technical Stack Requirements

### Frontend
- **Static Site**: Docusaurus 3.x (Node.js 18+, React 18)
- **Chat UI**: React component embedded in Docusaurus with WebSocket or SSE support
- **Styling**: Docusaurus themes + custom CSS modules
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (static hosting)

### Backend (RAG Chatbot)
- **API Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **AI Orchestration**: OpenAI Agents SDK or ChatKit SDK
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions) or text-embedding-3-large (3072 dimensions)
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-4-turbo for chat completions
- **Hosting**: Vercel, Railway, Render, or similar serverless platform with ASGI support

### Data Layer
- **Primary Store**: Neon Serverless Postgres (pgvector extension for embeddings)
- **Vector Search**: Qdrant Cloud Free Tier (1GB storage, 100K vectors limit)
- **Embedding Strategy**: Dual-write to both Postgres and Qdrant for redundancy
- **Query Strategy**: Qdrant for fast top-k similarity, Postgres for metadata filtering and full-text search

### DevOps & Observability
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (build, test, deploy)
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging (JSON format), error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables, never hardcoded
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, chore)

### Security
- **API Authentication**: API keys for chatbot backend (rate limiting, CORS configuration)
- **Data Privacy**: No PII in embeddings or logs
- **HTTPS**: All production endpoints MUST use TLS
- **Dependencies**: Regular security audits with npm audit / pip-audit

## Governance

### Constitution Authority
This constitution supersedes all other project practices. Any violation MUST be documented with explicit justification in the implementation plan (plan.md) under "Complexity Tracking" or in an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

### Amendment Process
Amendments require:
1. **Proposal**: Document proposed changes with rationale
2. **Impact Analysis**: Identify affected templates, workflows, and artifacts
3. **Review**: Approve with project maintainers (minimum 2 approvals)
4. **Migration Plan**: Define steps to update existing work
5. **Version Bump**: Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
6. **Propagation**: Update all dependent templates and documentation

### Versioning Policy
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to core principles or governance (e.g., removing test-first requirement)
- **MINOR**: New principles added, significant expansions to existing principles
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review
- All PRs MUST verify compliance with constitutional principles
- Complexity violations MUST be explicitly justified in plan.md or ADR
- Annual constitution review to ensure principles remain relevant

### Runtime Development Guidance
Agents and developers MUST consult this constitution before starting new features. When in doubt, prefer simplicity and adherence to stated principles over clever solutions. Use CLAUDE.md for agent-specific execution guidance.
