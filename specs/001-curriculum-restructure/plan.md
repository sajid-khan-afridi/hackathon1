# Implementation Plan: Physical AI Book Curriculum Restructure

**Branch**: `001-curriculum-restructure` | **Date**: 2025-12-04 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-curriculum-restructure/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Restructure the Physical AI book content to match the finalized 4-module, 13-week curriculum. Replace existing placeholder chapters (chapter-01-foundations, chapter-02-mechanics) with a progressive learning path spanning Module 1 (ROS 2), Module 2 (Gazebo/Unity), Module 3 (NVIDIA Isaac), and Module 4 (VLA), culminating in an Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project. Content will be organized using Docusaurus autogenerated sidebars with proper frontmatter, enabling learners to progress from foundational concepts through advanced autonomous robotics systematically.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Node.js 18+, Markdown/MDX
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus 3.x (React 18, @docusaurus/preset-classic), @easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local
**Storage**: File-based Markdown documents in docs/ directory, GitHub repository
**Testing**: Playwright (end-to-end navigation tests), link validation via onBrokenLinks config
**Target Platform**: Static site hosted on GitHub Pages (browser-based, responsive design)
**Project Type**: Documentation site (Docusaurus static site generator)
**Performance Goals**: Fast page load (<2s), instant search results, responsive navigation
**Constraints**: Must maintain autogenerated sidebars, proper frontmatter structure, and SEO metadata
**Scale/Scope**: 4 modules, 13 weeks of content, ~50-70 markdown pages, progressive curriculum structure

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Content-First Documentation
✅ **PASS**: This feature is purely content restructuring. All 13 weeks will be written in Markdown with clear learning objectives, progressive complexity (foundational → advanced), and practical examples per constitutional requirement.

### Principle II: Docusaurus Architecture
✅ **PASS**: Feature uses existing Docusaurus 3.x infrastructure. Will use autogenerated sidebars (sidebars.ts: type='autogenerated'). All new content will include required YAML frontmatter (title, sidebar_position, description) plus custom fields (module, week).

### Principle III: GitHub Pages Deployment
✅ **PASS**: No changes to deployment pipeline. Existing CI/CD will handle new content automatically. Build validation via `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` in docusaurus.config.ts ensures link integrity.

### Principle IV: RAG Chatbot Integration
⚠️ **DEFERRED**: RAG chatbot is out of scope for this curriculum restructure. Future feature will ingest new curriculum content into vector stores.

### Principle V: Hybrid Storage Architecture
⚠️ **DEFERRED**: Vector storage not applicable to content restructuring. Will be addressed when RAG system is implemented.

### Principle VI: Modern AI Stack
⚠️ **DEFERRED**: Backend AI stack not applicable to content restructuring. Static site only.

### Principle VII: Test-First for Critical Paths
✅ **PASS**: Existing Playwright tests cover navigation, links, and responsive design. Will verify new module structure passes all tests. Content accuracy is editorial review, not automated testing.

### Existing Docusaurus Infrastructure (NO CHANGES)

```

**Structure Decision**: This is a documentation restructuring within a Docusaurus static site. All work is content creation in the docs/ directory. Existing placeholder chapters (chapter-01-foundations, chapter-02-mechanics) will be removed and replaced with the 4-module, 13-week structure. Autogenerated sidebars will automatically reflect the new folder hierarchy. No code changes required.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

No constitutional violations detected. All principles either pass or are explicitly deferred (RAG/backend components out of scope for content restructuring).
