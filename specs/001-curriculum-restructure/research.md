# Research: Physical AI Curriculum Restructure

**Feature**: 001-curriculum-restructure
**Date**: 2025-12-04
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish best practices for 13-week curriculum structure

## Overview

This research document captures pedagogical best practices, content organization strategies, and technical decisions for restructuring the Physical AI book into a 4-module, 13-week curriculum. All "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items from Technical Context have been resolved.

## Research Areas

### 1. Curriculum Pedagogy & Progressive Learning

**Research Question**: How should a 13-week technical curriculum be structured to maximize learning progression from foundational to advanced concepts?

**Decision**: Adopt Bloom's Taxonomy-based progression model
- **Weeks 1-2**: Remember/Understand (Introduction to Physical AI, foundational concepts)
- **Weeks 3-5**: Apply (ROS 2 hands-on exercises, node creation, topic publishing)
- **Weeks 6-7**: Analyze (Simulation environments, comparing Gazebo vs Unity)
- **Weeks 8-10**: Evaluate (AI-powered perception, reinforcement learning trade-offs)
- **Weeks 11-13**: Create (Autonomous Humanoid Capstone integrating all modules)

**Rationale**: Bloom's Taxonomy provides a pedagogically proven framework for progressive skill development. Research shows learners need 2-3 weeks of foundational knowledge before applying concepts practically.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Problem-based learning (rejected: too advanced for beginners without foundational knowledge)
- Spiral curriculum (rejected: too much context-switching across 13 weeks)

**Sources**:
- Bloom, B.S. (1956). Taxonomy of Educational Objectives
- Freeman et al. (2014). Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics. PNAS

### 2. Docusaurus Content Organization Best Practices

**Research Question**: What folder structure and frontmatter conventions best support autogenerated sidebars in Docusaurus for sequential curriculum content?

**Decision**: Module-based folder structure with index.md entry points and sidebar_position ordering

**Structure Pattern**:
```
docs/
├── module-XX-<name>/
│   ├── index.md                    # sidebar_position: 1
│   ├── week-YY-<topic>.md          # sidebar_position: 2, 3, 4...
```

**Frontmatter Template**:
```yaml
---
title: "Week N: Topic Title"
description: "Brief description for SEO and metadata"
sidebar_position: N
module: "Module X: Name"
week: N
difficulty: "beginner|intermediate|advanced"
learning_objectives:
  - "Objective 1"
  - "Objective 2"
prerequisites:
  - "Prerequisite from earlier week"
estimated_time: "X minutes"
keywords:
  - "keyword1"
  - "keyword2"
---
```

**Rationale**: Docusaurus autogenerated sidebars respect sidebar_position for ordering. Module folders create natural category groupings. Index.md files provide module overviews while week-XX-topic.md files maintain sequential ordering.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flat structure with chapter-XX naming (rejected: no module grouping, harder to navigate)
- Manual sidebars configuration (rejected: violates autogenerated sidebar principle from constitution)

### 3. MDX Code Snippet Best Practices for Technical Education

**Research Question**: How should code examples be presented in a robotics/AI curriculum? Inline snippets vs. external repositories?

**Decision**: Hybrid approach (inline snippets + GitHub repo links)

**Pattern**:
- **Core Concepts**: Inline MDX code blocks with syntax highlighting (15-30 lines)
- **Complete Projects**: External GitHub repository links with installation instructions
- **Interactive Demos**: CodeSandbox/Replit embeds where applicable (future enhancement)

**Example**:
```markdown
## ROS 2 Node Creation

Here's a minimal ROS 2 publisher node in Python:

\```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MinimalPublisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
\```

**Complete working example**: [GitHub: ros2-minimal-publisher](https://github.com/example/ros2-examples)
```

**Rationale**: Inline snippets provide immediate context and are searchable by Algolia DocSearch. External repos offer complete working environments without cluttering book content. This balances pedagogical clarity with practical utility.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- All code in external repos (rejected: breaks reading flow, harder to search)
- All code inline (rejected: 500+ line projects make pages unwieldy)

**Sources**:
- Nielsen Norman Group: Code Examples in Technical Documentation (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/code-examples/)
- FR-015a from spec.md (hybrid approach requirement)

### 4. GPU Access Alternatives for NVIDIA Isaac Module

**Research Question**: What cloud-based GPU solutions should be recommended for learners without local NVIDIA GPUs?

**Decision**: Provide tiered recommendations with setup instructions

**Recommended Options**:
1. **Google Colab** (Free/Pro)
   - Free tier: Tesla T4 GPU, 12GB VRAM, 12-hour session limit
   - Pro: $10/month, A100 GPU access, 24-hour sessions
   - Best for: Beginners, quick experiments

2. **Paperspace Gradient** (Free/Paid)
   - Free tier: M4000 GPU, limited hours
   - Growth: $8/month, RTX 4000 GPU
   - Best for: Persistent workspaces, longer projects

3. **AWS SageMaker** (Pay-per-use)
   - ml.g4dn.xlarge: NVIDIA T4, $0.526/hour
   - Best for: Production-level training, educational credits

**Rationale**: Multi-tiered approach accommodates different budgets and skill levels. Google Colab has lowest barrier to entry. Paperspace offers persistent environments for week-long projects. AWS provides enterprise-grade experience.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Local installation only (rejected: excludes learners without NVIDIA GPUs per FR-012a)
- Single cloud provider (rejected: vendor lock-in, single point of failure)

**Sources**:
- FR-012a from spec.md (cloud GPU requirement)
- Google Colab Documentation (https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html)
- Paperspace Gradient Pricing (https://www.paperspace.com/gradient/pricing)

### 5. Prerequisite Knowledge & Week 1-2 Scope

**Research Question**: What foundational knowledge should learners have before starting, and what should Week 1-2 cover?

**Decision**: Assume basic Python programming literacy and command-line familiarity

**Prerequisites (Before Week 1)**:
- Basic Python syntax (variables, functions, classes, loops)
- Command-line navigation (cd, ls, mkdir, running scripts)
- Text editor proficiency (VS Code, Vim, or similar)

**Week 1-2 Curriculum Focus**:
- Physical AI concepts (NOT Python basics)
- Embodied intelligence theory
- Humanoid robotics landscape
- Sensor systems overview

**Rationale**: Teaching Python basics dilutes focus on Physical AI. Most robotics/AI learners already have programming experience. Weeks 1-2 should establish domain-specific knowledge, not programming fundamentals.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Start with Python/Git basics (rejected: out of scope, too elementary for target audience)
- Assume ROS 2 knowledge (rejected: ROS 2 is Module 1 content, not a prerequisite)

**Sources**:
- FR-003a, FR-004 from spec.md (prerequisite clarification)
- Clarifications section (2025-12-04 session Q&A)

## Key Findings Summary

| Area | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Pedagogical Model | Bloom's Taxonomy progression (13 weeks) | Proven framework for skill development |
| Folder Structure | module-XX-<name>/ with index.md + week-YY-<topic>.md | Supports autogenerated sidebars, maintains sequence |
| Code Examples | Hybrid: Inline snippets (15-30 lines) + GitHub repos | Balances clarity with practical utility |
| GPU Access | Google Colab / Paperspace / AWS SageMaker | Multi-tiered, accommodates all budgets |
| Prerequisites | Basic Python + CLI literacy | Focuses curriculum on Physical AI, not programming basics |

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Content Authoring**: Follow quickstart.md (Phase 1 output) for frontmatter templates and folder structure
2. **Module Sequencing**: Each module's index.md must include:
   - Learning objectives (from spec.md FRs)
   - Prerequisites (explicit references to prior modules)
   - Estimated completion time per week
3. **Hands-On Exercises**: Minimum 1 practical exercise per week (FR-015), increasing complexity each module
4. **Capstone Integration**: Week 13 must explicitly reference prior weeks' concepts (FR-019)

## Outstanding Questions

None. All technical unknowns resolved.
